# Human Activity Recognition using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using sensor data from the PML Training Dataset.  
Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated to classify different human activities based on accelerometer and gyroscope readings.
